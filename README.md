# Module 11 Challenge: Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup

## Overview
In this challenge, I leveraged **Beautiful Soup**, a powerful Python library for web scraping, to extract and analyze data from web pages. This module focuses on understanding how to navigate HTML structures and collect meaningful insights from web content.

## Objectives
1. **Web Scraping**:
   - Use Beautiful Soup to parse HTML and extract specific data elements such as text, tables, links, and images.

2. **Data Manipulation**:
   - Clean and organize the scraped data for analysis.
   - Export the data into formats like CSV or JSON for further use.

3. **Understanding HTML**:
   - Learn how to traverse HTML structures such as tags, attributes, and hierarchies to locate the desired information.

4. **Ethics and Best Practices**:
   - Understand the ethical implications of web scraping.
   - Implement respectful scraping practices by adhering to website terms of service and avoiding overwhelming servers.

## Key Deliverables
- A Python script that:
  - Retrieves and parses HTML content using Beautiful Soup.
  - Extracts specified data elements from the webpage.
  - Cleans, organizes, and stores the data in a usable format.
- Documentation of the web scraping process, including code and insights.

## Usage
1. Install the required libraries.
2. Run the script to scrape and extract data from the target webpage.
3. Review and analyze the scraped data output.

## Notes
- Always check the **robots.txt** file of the target website to ensure compliance with web scraping policies.
- Ensure the script can handle potential errors like missing tags, invalid URLs, or denied access.
